    <p>The Starter kits sold by <a href="https://freenove.com">Freenove</a> are a fun introduction to electronics and the use of the Raspberry Pi GPIO-pins.
One of Freenoves drawbacks is the use of of the deprecated wiringPi library, for which documentation is hard to find nowadays.
For learning programming in C their code is useless as they switch to C++ after a few chapters without warning or explanation.</p>

<p>I re-wrote their project code  using the <a href="https://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/">pigpio</a> library, for both the C code and the python code.
This repository also reflects my learning curve using this library. I tried to let clarity and simplicity override being smart and concise.
The first chapters in both C and Python are more or less &#39;hello-world-level&#39;. Around chapter 20  a little more advanced programming techniques as bitwise operations, hexadecimal numbering are used.</p>

<p>All the electronic projects gave the desired output on my Raspberry Pi4 using Raspbian (Buster).
I expect them to work on all raspberry Pi 1-4 versions, but not on the  Raspberry Pi5.
Use it at your own risk of course. Suggestions, remarks, and improvements are welcome.</p>
